# Cisco_Hotel_network_management_system_project
This network design outlines a Hotel Network Management System. The network is divided into five distinct areas: Receptions, Office 1, Office 2, Office 3, and Server Room.

The system utilizes DHCP, DNS, and HTTP servers to support network operations. Five switches are deployed, one per department, with two switches connected to each of two routers. The third router connects to a single switch.

Each network area is assigned a default gateway, and all PCs have unique IP addresses.
